## :question: What is bolt?

bolt is the Universal Project Runner that runs Docker containers, child processes, or even encapsulate your entire project within a VM, all under one unified API.

Below's brief overview of bolt's architecture -

## :thinking: Why bolt?

Running projects locally requires running system services and using system resources.

For eg: A project may need to run a Postgres instance, an iOS simulator and a Node watcher & bundler.

It can get cumbersome when you set up everything manually because you may need a Docker instance for the Postgres, a child process on the host machine to boot the iOS simulator and another child process for the Node packager. The Node packager can also run as a Docker instance.

And when you run all these, the host machine may slow down and you may have to move things inside a VM. Bolt solves all those problems with a unified API for managing services (boot, kill, restart, fetch logs).

Below's brief overview of how bolt's architecture designed to help in such scenarios  -
